You've long felt that something in the Dreamlands has been calling to you, and that some great rescue or revelation awaits in a dream you've yet to experience. In the meantime, your dreams remain a potent source of inspiration and power, and the ability to draw from them to affect the waking world is something you've always been able to do. When you attempt an Arcana, Nature, Religion, or Occultism check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Recall Knowledge], or when you attempt a check to Craft any work of art, you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed at a check to Craft or at a Recall Knowledge check about a subject associated with dreaming or the Dreamlands, you regain a Mythic Point.</p><hr /><p><strong>Edicts</strong> share your dreams with your friends and take interest if they share their dreams with you, take inspiration from your dreams when you create</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> deny a creature (including yourself) the chance to sleep long enough to dream, deride those who have ambitions that they're unlikely to ever achieve</p>"
